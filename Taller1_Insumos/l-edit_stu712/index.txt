EXT_devc.md    A model list file for Layout vs. Schematic (LVS)
               verification. This file is being referred during an LVS
               execution.  It is not a SPICE model file for simulation.
EXT_SubC.elm   An element file containing all of the cells in the Tanner
               Standard Cell Libraries.  For Sub-Circuit Level LVS when
               layout are extracted with L-Edit/EXT's Recognize Subcircuit
               Extract option.
